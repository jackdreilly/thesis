Future 
work includes investigating decentralized, coordinated control schemes over physical 
networks via the adjoint method to allow traffic control strategies to scale to 
regional-scale networks.

As future work, we will develop methods that leverage knowledge of freeway dynamics to detect when a compromise of the traffic control system has occurred and how to mitigate the potential harm. For instance, as already demonstrated on water SCADA systems~\cite{amin2013cyber}, one can detect when sensor readings lie outside those expected given the dynamical assumptions and classify such a sensor as faulty or compromised.

During the study of ramp metering attacks, we discovered a greater generality of the combined optimal control/multi-objective approach to freeway applications. We will extend our method to freeway \emph{calibration}~\cite{Jacqueta} where one interactively optimizes over model parameters to allow model simulations to match recorded observations.
