abstract = {A macroscopic modeling framework for dynamic traffic phenomena on multidestination freeway and/or road networks with time varying demands is developed. A key variable of the model at each network node are the splitting rates of each traffic subflow with a specific destination. Two approaches are investigated for resolving the dynamic assignment and the route guidance problem: first, an optimal control approach for achieving a dynamic system or user optimum; second, a feedback concept for establishing dynamic user optimal conditions. The overall approach allows for integrated design of individual and/or collective route guidance, ramp metering, and signal setting in freeway and/or road networks. Some examples are provided.},

@article{Jin2005,
abstract = {User equilibrium is a central concept for studying transportation networks, and one can view it as the result of a dynamical process of drivers' route choice behavior. In this paper, based on a definition of O-D First-In-First-Out violation, we propose a new dynamical system model of the route choice behavior at the aggregate, route level for both static and dynamic transportation networks. An equilibrium of such a dynamical system can be a user equilibrium or a partial user equilibrium. We prove that, for static, symmetric traffic assignment problem with fixed or variable demand, only user equilibria are stable for the dynamical system, and the objective function in the mathematical programming formulation (Beckmann, McGuire, and Winsten, 1956) can be considered as the potential energy of the dynamical system. We then present an Euler-based perturbation method for finding user equilibrium and solve two examples for both static and dynamic traffic assignment problems. This new model is simple in form and could be applied to analyze other properties of transportation networks.},

abstract = {This paper is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

abstract = {Can one use cell phones for earthquake early warning? Detecting rare, disruptive events using community-held sensors is a promising opportunity, but also presents difficult challenges. Rare events are often difficult or impossible to model and characterize a priori, yet we wish to maximize detection performance. Further, heterogeneous, community-operated sensors may differ widely in quality and communication constraints. In this paper, we present a principled approach towards detecting rare events that learns sensor-specific decision thresholds online, in a distributed way. It maximizes anomaly detection performance at a fusion center, under constraints on the false alarm rate and number of messages per sensor. We then present an implementation of our approach in the Community Seismic Network (CSN), a community sensing system with the goal of rapidly detecting earthquakes using cell phone accelerometers, consumer USB devices and cloud-computing based sensor fusion. We experimentally evaluate our approach based on a pilot deployment of the CSN system. Our results, including data from shake table experiments, indicate the effectiveness of our approach in distinguishing seismic motion from accelerations due to normal daily manipulation. They also provide evidence of the feasibility of earthquake early warning using a dense network of cell phones.},

@article{Cole2006a,
abstract = {We study economic incentives for influencing selfish behavior in networks. We consider a model of selfish routing in which the latency experienced by network traffic on an edge of the network is a function of the edge congestion, and network users are assumed to selfishly route traffic on minimum-latency paths. The quality of a routing of traffic is historically measured by the sum of all travel times, also called the total latency.. It is well known that the outcome of selfish routing (a flow at Nash equilibrium) does not minimize the total latency, and that marginal cost pricing-charging each network user for the congestion effects caused by its presence-eliminates the inefficiency of selfish routing. However, the principle of marginal cost pricing assumes that taxes cause no disutility to network users; this is appropriate only when collected taxes can be feasibly returned (directly or indirectly) to the users, If this assumption does not hold and we wish to minimize the total user disutility (latency plus taxes paid)-the total cost-how should we price the network edges? Intuition may suggest that taxes can never improve the cost of a Nash equilibrium, but the famous Braess's Paradox shows this intuition to be incorrect. We consider strategies for pricing network edges to reduce the cost of a Nash equilibrium. Since levying a sufficiently large tax on an edge effectively removes it from the network, our study generalizes previous work on designing networks for selfish users T Roughgarden, Designing networks for selfish users is hard, in: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2001, pp. 472-481 (full version to appear in Journal of Computer and System Sciences). In this paper, we prove the following results. In a large class of networks-including all networks with linear latency functions-marginal cost taxes do not improve the cost of a Nash equilibrium. The largest-possible benefit from taxes does not exceed that from edge removals. In ever), network with linear latency functions, the benefit of taxes cannot exceed that of removing edges. There are networks with nonlinear latency functions, however, in which taxes are radically more powerful than edge removals. For every epsilon > 0, there is no (4/3 - epsilon)-approximation algorithm for computing optimal taxes, even in networks with linear latency functions (assuming P not equal NP).

abstract = {Thanks to the important and increasing growth of the carpooling phenomenon throughout the world, many researchers have particularly focused their efforts on this concept. Most of the existent systems present multiple drawbacks regarding automation, functionalities, accessibility, etc. Besides, only few researchers focused on real time carpooling concept without producing promising results. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel approach called DOMARTiC: a Distributed Optimized approach based on the Multi-Agent concept for the implementation of a Real Time Carpooling service. We particularly focus on the distributed and dynamic aspect not only within the geographical networks representation but also regarding the used automatic tools and the implementing algorithms. Adequate modeling on the base of which a distributed architecture is set up has been adopted helping to perform decentralized parallel process. This helped to take into consideration different aspects we should be involved in, especially the optimization issue as users' requests must be performed in a reasonable runtime. Responses provided to users should also be efficient with regards to the fixed optimization criteria},

abstract = {On the heels of compressed sensing, a new field has very recently emerged. This field addresses a broad range of problems of significant practical interest, namely, the recovery of a data matrix from what appears to be incomplete, and perhaps even corrupted, information. In its simplest form, the problem is to recover a matrix from a small sample of its entries. It comes up in many areas of science and engineering, including collaborative filtering, machine learning, control, remote sensing, and computer vision, to name a few. This paper surveys the novel literature on matrix completion, which shows that under some suitable conditions, one can recover an unknown low-rank matrix from a nearly minimal set of entries by solving a simple convex optimization problem, namely, nuclear-norm minimization subject to data constraints. Further, this paper introduces novel results showing that matrix completion is provably accurate even when the few observed entries are corrupted with a small amount of noise. A typical result is that one can recover an unknown matrix of low rank from just about log noisy samples with an error that is proportional to the noise level. We present numerical results that complement our quantitative analysis and show that, in practice, nuclear-norm minimization accurately fills in the many missing entries of large low-rank matrices from just a few noisy samples. Some analogies between matrix completion and compressed sensing are discussed throughout.},

@inproceedings{Claudel2009,
abstract = {This article investigates the problem of incorporating mobile probe data collected from GPS equipped cell phones into estimation algorithms for travel time. We use kinematic wave theory to create a modeling framework capable of incorporating trajectory data into the model. The problem of including loop detector data in this model is performed using a standard approach available in the literature. The problem of fusing this data with probe data is formulated using the Moskowitz function, which results from kinematic wave theory. Using this formulation, two linear programs are posed to compute upper and lower bounds travel time through the corresponding section of highway. The method thus provides a guaranteed range for the average travel time experienced by vehicles on the highway. The method is illustrated with data collected during the Mobile Century experiment on February 8th, 2008, using 100 Nokia N95 phones traveling onboard cars driving loops on I880 in California. A sampling and penetration rate study shows that the method provides accurate travel time estimates for penetration rates as low as 0.1\% and spatial sampling strategies on the order of 0.2 miles. The performance of the method is illustrated with several case studies, in which measurements gathered by a few vehicles are sufficient to significantly improve results obtained from sparse loop detectors.},

@article{Herrera2010,
abstract = {Cell-phones equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) provide new opportunities for location-based services and traffic estimation. When traveling on-board vehicles, these phones can be used to accurately provide position and velocity of the vehicle as probe traf- fic sensors. This article presents a new technique to incorporate mobile probe measure- ments into highway traffic flow models, and compares it to a Kalman filtering approach. These two techniques are both used to reconstruct traffic density. The first technique mod- ifies the LighthillWhithamRichards partial differential equation (PDE) to incorporate a correction term which reduces the discrepancy between the measurements (from the probe vehicles) and the estimated state (from the model). This technique, called Newtonian relaxation, nudges the model to the measurements. The second technique is based on Kalman filtering and the framework of hybrid systems, which implements an observer equation into a linearized flow model. Both techniques assume the knowledge of the fun- damental diagram and the conditions at both boundaries of the section of interest. The techniques are designed in a way in which does not require the knowledge of on- and off-ramp detector counts, which in practice are rarely available. The differences between both techniques are assessed in the context of the Next Generation Simulation program (NGSIM), which is used as a benchmark data set to compare both methods. They are finally tested with data from the Mobile Century experiment obtained from 100 Nokia N95 mobile phones on I-880 in California on February 8, 2008. The results are promising, showing that the proposed methods successfully incorporate the GPS data in the estimation of traffic.},

@article{Zaharia2010,
abstract = {MapReduce and its variants have been highly successful in implementing large-scale data intensive applications on clusters of unreliable machines. However, most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow programming model that is not suitable for other popular applications. In this paper, we focus on one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning algorithms, as well as interactive data analysis environments. We propose a new framework called Spark that supports these applications while maintaining the scalability and fault-tolerance properties of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark introduces a data abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39 GB dataset with sub-second response time.},

Estimation of shaking over the entire regional extent of southern California is obtained by the spatial interpolation of the measured ground motions with geologically based frequency and amplitude-dependent site corrections. Production of the maps is automatic, triggered by any significant earthquake in southern California. Maps are now made available within several minutes of the earthquake for public and scientific consumption via the World Wide Web; they will be made available with dedicated communications for emergency response agencies and critical users.},

abstract = {We study the numerical performance of a limited memory quasi-Newton method for large scale optimization, which we call the L-BFGS method. We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a Gaussian or binary distribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is sparse. Our approach is to solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added l1-norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but the memory requirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive for problems with more than tens of nodes. We present two new algorithms for solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our first algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive l1-norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov's first order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem size than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation of the log partition function (Wainwright \& Jordan (2006)), we show that these same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood problem for the binary case. We test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well as on gene expression and senate voting records data.},

Our algorithm is based on a variant of the existence proof due to Hart and Schmeidler, and employs linear programming duality, the ellipsoid algorithm, Markov chain steady state computations, as well as application-specific methods for computing multivariate expectations over product distributions. For anonymous games and graphical games of bounded tree-width, we provide a different polynomial-time algorithm for optimizing an arbitrary linear function over the set of correlated equilibria of the game. In contrast to our sweeping positive results for computing an arbitrary correlated equilibrium, we prove that optimizing over correlated equilibria is NP-hard in all of the other classes of games that we consider.},

@book{boyd2004convex,
abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

Recent literature focused on special cases of this formulation and studied their distributed solution through either subgradient based methods with O(1/sqrt(k)) rate of convergence (where k is the iteration number) or Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based methods, which require a synchronous implementation and a globally known order on the agents. In this paper, we present a novel asynchronous ADMM based distributed method for the general formulation and show that it converges at the rate O(1/k).},

@book{Reuther1996,
abstract = {This work describes the implementation of optimization techniques based on control theory for complex aircraft configurations. Here control theory is employed to derive the adjoint differential equations, the solution of which allows for a drastic reduction in computational costs over previous design methods (13, 12, 43, 38). In our earlier studies (19, 20, 22, 23, 39, 25, 40, 41, 42) it was shown that this method could be used to devise effective optimization procedures for airfoils, wings and wing-bodies subject to either analytic or arbitrary meshes. Design formulations for both potential flows and flows governed by the Euler equations have been demonstrated, showing that such methods can be devised for various governing equations (39, 25). In our most recent works (40, 42) the method was extended to treat wing-body configurations with a large number of mesh points, verifying that significant computational savings can be gained for practical design problems. In this paper the method is extended for the Euler equations to treat complete aircraft configurations via a new multiblock implementation. New elements include a multiblock-multigrid flow solver, a multiblock-multigrid adjoint solver, and a multiblock mesh perturbation scheme. Two design examples are presented in which the new method is used for the wing redesign of a transonic business jet.},

@article{Kurzhanskiy2010,
abstract = {Active traffic management (ATM) is the ability to dynamically manage recurrent and non-recurrent congestion based on prevailing traffic conditions in order to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of road networks. It is a continuous process of (i) obtaining and analysing traffic measurement data, (ii) operations planning, i.e. simulating various scenarios and control strategies, (iii) implementing the most promising control strategies in the field, and (iv) maintaining a real-time decision support system that filters current traffic measurements to predict the traffic state in the near future, and to suggest the best available control strategy for the predicted situation. ATM relies on a fast and trusted traffic simulator for the rapid quantitative assessment of a large number of control strategies for the road network under various scenarios, in a matter of minutes. The open-source macrosimulation tool Aurora ROAD NETWORK MODELER is a good candidate for this purpose. The paper describes the underlying dynamical traffic model and what it takes to prepare the model for simulation; covers the traffic performance measures and evaluation of scenarios as part of operations planning; introduces the framework within which the control strategies are modelled and evaluated; and presents the algorithm for real-time traffic state estimation and short-term prediction.},

abstract = {We present Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), a dis- tributed memory abstraction that allows programmers to perform in-memory computations on large clusters while retaining the fault tolerance of data flow models like MapReduce. RDDs are motivated by two types of applications that current data flow systems handle in- efficiently: iterative algorithms, which are common in graph applications and machine learning, and interac- tive data mining tools. In both cases, keeping data in memory can improve performance by an order of mag- nitude. To achieve fault tolerance efficiently, RDDs pro- vide a highly restricted form of shared memory: they are read-only datasets that can only be constructed through bulk operations on other RDDs. However, we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations, including MapReduce and specialized programming models for iterative jobs such as Pregel. Our implementation of RDDs can outperform Hadoop by 20 for iterative jobs and can be used interactively to search a 1 TB dataset with latencies of 57 seconds.},

@article{King2001,
abstract = {We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros ("nonevents"). In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99\% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.},

abstract = {We have designed and implemented the Google File System, a scalable distributed file system for large distributed data-intensive applications. It provides fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity hardware, and it delivers high aggregate performance to a large number of clients. While sharing many of the same goals as previous distributed file systems, our design has been driven by observations of our application workloads and technological environment, both current and anticipated, that reflect a marked departure from some earlier file system assumptions. This has led us to reexamine traditional choices and explore radically different design points. The file system has successfully met our storage needs. It is widely deployed within Google as the storage platform for the generation and processing of data used by our service as well as research and development efforts that require large data sets. The largest cluster to date provides hundreds of terabytes of storage across thousands of disks on over a thousand machines, and it is concurrently accessed by hundreds of clients. In this paper, we present file system interface extensions designed to support distributed applications, discuss many aspects of our design, and report measurements from both micro-benchmarks and real world use.},

abstract = {Arias Intensity is a ground motion parameter that captures the potential destructiveness of an earthquake as the integral of the square of the acceleration-time history. It correlates well with several commonly used demand measures of structural performance, liquefaction, and seismic slope stability. A new empirical relationship is developed to estimate Arias Intensity as a function of magnitude, distance, fault mechanism, and site category based on 1208 recorded ground motion data from 75 earthquakes in active plate-margins. Its functional form is derived from the point-source model, and the coefficients are determined through non-linear regression analyses using a random-effects model. The results show that for large magnitude earthquakes (M > 7) Arias Intensity was significantly overestimated by previous relationships while it was underestimated for smaller magnitude events (M 6). The average horizontal Arias Intensity is not significantly affected by forward rupture directivity in the near-fault region. The aleatory variability associated with Arias Intensity is larger than that of most other ground motion parameters such as spectral acceleration. However, it may be useful in assessing the potential seismic performance of stiff engineering systems whose response is dominated by the short-period characteristics of ground motions.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the system optimum-dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA) problem when the time-dependent demands are random variables with known probability distributions. The model is a stochastic extension of a deterministic linear programming formulation for SO-DTA introduced by Ziliaskopoulos (Ziliaskopoulos, A.K., 2000. A linear programming model for the single destination system optimum dynamic traffic assignment problem, Transportation Science, 34, 1-12). The proposed formulation is chance-constrained based and we demonstrate that it provides a robust SO solution with a user specified level of reliability. The model provides numerous insights and can be a useful tool in producing robust control and management strategies that account for uncertainty in applications where SO-DTA is relevant (e.g. evacuation modeling, computing alternate routes around freeway incidents and establishing lower bounds on network performance).

abstract = {The U.S. Geological Survey is tapping a vast new source of engineering seismology data through its "Did You Feel It?" (DYFI) program, which collects online citizen responses to earthquakes. To date, more than 750,000 responses have been compiled in the United States alone. The DYFI data make up in quantity what they may lack in scientific quality and offer the potential to resolve longstanding issues in earthquake ground-motion science. Such issues have been difficult to address due to the paucity of instrumental ground-motion data in regions of low seismicity. In particular, DYFI data provide strong evidence that earthquake stress drops, which control the strength of high-frequency ground shaking, are higher in the central and eastern United States (CEUS) than in California. Higher earthquake stress drops, coupled with lower attenuation of shaking with distance, result in stronger overall shaking over a wider area and thus more potential damage for CEUS earthquakes in comparison to those of equal magnitude in California-a fact also definitively captured with these new DYFI data and maps},

abstract = {This article considers a mechanism based on rebates that aims at reducing congestion in urban networks. The framework helps select rebate levels so that enough commuters switch to modes that are under used. Indeed, getting a relative small number of drivers to switch to public transportation can significantly improve congestion. This mechanism is modeled by a Stackelberg game in which the transportation authority offers rebates, and participants factor them into the costs of each mode. A new Wardrop equilibrium arises when participants selfishly select one of the modes of transportation with the lowest updated costs. Rebate levels are chosen taking into account not only the potential reduction of the participants' cost, but also the cost of providing those rebates. Part of the budget for rebates may come from the savings that arise from the more efficient use of capacity. We characterize the Stackelberg equilibria of the game, and describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the optimal rebates for each mode. In addition, we provide tight results on the worst-case inefficiency of the resulting Wardrop equilibrium, measured by the so-called price of anarchy. Specifically, we describe the tradeoff between the sensitivity of the owner towards rebate costs and the worst-case inefficiency of the system.},

abstract = {We present Mesos, a platform for sharing commodity clusters between multiple diverse cluster computing frameworks, such as Hadoop and MPI. Sharing improves cluster utilization and avoids per-framework data replication. Mesos shares resources in a fine-grained manner, allowing frameworks to achieve data locality by taking turns reading data stored on each machine. To support the sophisticated schedulers of today's frameworks, Mesos introduces a distributed two-level scheduling mechanism called resource offers. Mesos decides how many resources to offer each framework, while frameworks decide which resources to accept and which computations to run on them. Our experimental results show that Mesos can achieve near-optimal locality when sharing the cluster among diverse frameworks, can scale up to 50,000 nodes, and is resilient to node failures.},

@article{Reilly2013,
abstract = {There are a variety of approaches to seismic sensing, which range from collecting sparse measurements with high-fidelity seismic stations to non-quantitative, post-earthquake surveys. The sparse nature of the high-fidelity stations and the inaccuracy of the surveys create the need for a high-density, semi-quantitative approach to seismic sensing. To fill this void, the UC Berkeley iShake project designed a mobile client-backend server architecture that uses sensor-equipped mobile devices to measure earthquake ground shaking. iShake provides the general public with a service to more easily contribute more quantitatively significant data to earthquake research by automating the data collection and reporting mechanisms via the iShake mobile application. The devices act as distributed sensors that enable measurements to be taken and transmitted with a cellular network connection. Shaking table testing was used to assess the quality of the measurements obtained from the iPhones and iPods on a benchmark of 150 ground motions. Once triggered by a shaking event, the devices transmit sensor data to a backend server for further processing. After a seismic event is verified by high-fidelity stations, filtering algorithms are used to detect falling phones, as well as device-specific responses to the event. A method was developed to determine the absolute orientation of a device to estimate the direction of first motion of a seismic event. A “virtual earthquake” pilot test was conducted on the UC Berkeley campus to verify the operation of the iShake system. By designing and fully implementing a system architecture, developing signal processing techniques unique to mobile sensing, and conducting shaking table tests to confirm the validity of the sensing platform, the iShake project serves as foundational work for further studies in seismic sensing on mobile devices.},

The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multinomial regression problems while the penalties include ℓ(1) (the lasso), ℓ(2) (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.},

@misc{Mateos2010,
abstract = {The Lasso is a popular technique for joint estimation and continuous variable selection, especially well-suited for sparse and possibly under-determined linear regression problems. This paper develops algorithms to estimate the regression coefficients via Lasso when the training data are distributed across different agents, and their communication to a central processing unit is prohibited for e.g., communication cost or privacy reasons. A motivating application is explored in the context of wireless communications, whereby sensing cognitive radios collaborate to estimate the radio-frequency power spectrum density. Attaining different tradeoffs between complexity and convergence speed, three novel algorithms are obtained after reformulating the Lasso into a separable form, which is iteratively minimized using the alternating-direction method of multipliers so as to gain the desired degree of parallelization. Interestingly, the per agent estimate updates are given by simple soft-thresholding operations, and inter-agent communication overhead remains at affordable level. Without exchanging elements from the different training sets, the local estimates consent to the global Lasso solution, i.e., the fit that would be obtained if the entire data set were centrally available. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real data demonstrate the merits of the proposed distributed schemes, corroborating their convergence and global optimality. The ideas in this paper can be easily extended for the purpose of fitting related models in a distributed fashion, including the adaptive Lasso, elastic net, fused Lasso and nonnegative garrote.},

Drawing on interviews with Reuters personnel and access to Reuters doc- umentation, we describe the coding policy and quality control procedures used in producing the RCV1 data, the intended semantics of the hierarchical category taxonomies, and the corrections necessary to remove errorful data. We refer to the original data as RCV1-v1, and the corrected data as RCV1-v2. We benchmark several widely used supervised learning methods on RCV1-v2, illus- trating the collections properties, suggesting new directions for research, and providing baseline results for future studies. We make available detailed, per-category experimental results, as well as corrected versions of the category assignments and taxonomy structures, via online appendices.},

Roch, Savard, and Marcotte (Networks, Vol. 46(1), 57-67, 2005) proved that this problem is NP-hard, and gave an O(log m)-approximation algorithm, where m denote the number of arcs to be priced.

BP finds the least L1-norm solution of the underdetermined linear system Ax = b and is used, for example, in compressed sensing for reconstruction. Our algorithm solves BP on a distributed platform such as a sensor network, and is designed to minimize the communication between nodes. The algorithm only requires the network to be connected, has no notion of a central processing node, and no node has access to the entire matrix A at any time. We consider two scenarios in which either the columns or the rows of A are distributed among the compute nodes. Our algorithm, named D-ADMM, is a decentralized implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers. We show through numerical simulation that our algorithm requires considerably less communications between the nodes than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Our algorithm is based on a variant of the existence proof due to Hart and Schmeidler, and employs linear programming duality, the ellipsoid algorithm, Markov chain steady state computations, as well as application-specific methods for computing multivariate expectations over product distributions. For anonymous games and graphical games of bounded tree-width, we provide a different polynomial-time algorithm for optimizing an arbitrary linear function over the set of correlated equilibria of the game. In contrast to our sweeping positive results for computing an arbitrary correlated equilibrium, we prove that optimizing over correlated equilibria is NP-hard in all of the other classes of games that we consider.},

@article{Kurzhanskiy2010a,
abstract = {Active traffic management (ATM) is the ability to dynamically manage recurrent and non-recurrent congestion based on prevailing traffic conditions in order to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of road networks. It is a continuous process of (i) obtaining and analysing traffic measurement data, (ii) operations planning, i.e. simulating various scenarios and control strategies, (iii) implementing the most promising control strategies in the field, and (iv) maintaining a real-time decision support system that filters current traffic measurements to predict the traffic state in the near future, and to suggest the best available control strategy for the predicted situation. ATM relies on a fast and trusted traffic simulator for the rapid quantitative assessment of a large number of control strategies for the road network under various scenarios, in a matter of minutes. The open-source macrosimulation tool Aurora ROAD NETWORK MODELER is a good candidate for this purpose. The paper describes the underlying dynamical traffic model and what it takes to prepare the model for simulation; covers the traffic performance measures and evaluation of scenarios as part of operations planning; introduces the framework within which the control strategies are modelled and evaluated; and presents the algorithm for real-time traffic state estimation and short-term prediction.},

@book{Boyd2010b,
abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

@article{Maille2009c,
abstract = {This article considers a mechanism based on rebates that aims at reducing congestion in urban networks. The framework helps select rebate levels so that enough commuters switch to modes that are under used. Indeed, getting a relative small number of drivers to switch to public transportation can significantly improve congestion. This mechanism is modeled by a Stackelberg game in which the transportation authority offers rebates, and participants factor them into the costs of each mode. A new Wardrop equilibrium arises when participants selfishly select one of the modes of transportation with the lowest updated costs. Rebate levels are chosen taking into account not only the potential reduction of the participants' cost, but also the cost of providing those rebates. Part of the budget for rebates may come from the savings that arise from the more efficient use of capacity. We characterize the Stackelberg equilibria of the game, and describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the optimal rebates for each mode. In addition, we provide tight results on the worst-case inefficiency of the resulting Wardrop equilibrium, measured by the so-called price of anarchy. Specifically, we describe the tradeoff between the sensitivity of the owner towards rebate costs and the worst-case inefficiency of the system.},

@article{Jin2005a,
abstract = {User equilibrium is a central concept for studying transportation networks, and one can view it as the result of a dynamical process of drivers' route choice behavior. In this paper, based on a definition of O-D First-In-First-Out violation, we propose a new dynamical system model of the route choice behavior at the aggregate, route level for both static and dynamic transportation networks. An equilibrium of such a dynamical system can be a user equilibrium or a partial user equilibrium. We prove that, for static, symmetric traffic assignment problem with fixed or variable demand, only user equilibria are stable for the dynamical system, and the objective function in the mathematical programming formulation (Beckmann, McGuire, and Winsten, 1956) can be considered as the potential energy of the dynamical system. We then present an Euler-based perturbation method for finding user equilibrium and solve two examples for both static and dynamic traffic assignment problems. This new model is simple in form and could be applied to analyze other properties of transportation networks.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the system optimum-dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA) problem when the time-dependent demands are random variables with known probability distributions. The model is a stochastic extension of a deterministic linear programming formulation for SO-DTA introduced by Ziliaskopoulos (Ziliaskopoulos, A.K., 2000. A linear programming model for the single destination system optimum dynamic traffic assignment problem, Transportation Science, 34, 1-12). The proposed formulation is chance-constrained based and we demonstrate that it provides a robust SO solution with a user specified level of reliability. The model provides numerous insights and can be a useful tool in producing robust control and management strategies that account for uncertainty in applications where SO-DTA is relevant (e.g. evacuation modeling, computing alternate routes around freeway incidents and establishing lower bounds on network performance).

@article{TravisWaller2006,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the system optimum-dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA) problem when the time-dependent demands are random variables with known probability distributions. The model is a stochastic extension of a deterministic linear programming formulation for SO-DTA introduced by Ziliaskopoulos (Ziliaskopoulos, A.K., 2000. A linear programming model for the single destination system optimum dynamic traffic assignment problem, Transportation Science, 34, 1-12). The proposed formulation is chance-constrained based and we demonstrate that it provides a robust SO solution with a user specified level of reliability. The model provides numerous insights and can be a useful tool in producing robust control and management strategies that account for uncertainty in applications where SO-DTA is relevant (e.g. evacuation modeling, computing alternate routes around freeway incidents and establishing lower bounds on network performance).

@article{Giles2001,
abstract = {Optimal design methods involving the solution of an adjoint system of equations are an active area of research in computational fluid dynamics, particularly for aeronautical applications. This paper presents an introduction to the subject, emphasising the simplicity of the ideas when viewed in the context of linear algebra. Detailed discussions also include the extension to p.d.e.s, the construction of the adjoint p.d.e. and its boundary conditions, and the physical significance of the adjoint solution. The paper concludes with examples of the use of adjoint methods for optimising the design of business jets.},
