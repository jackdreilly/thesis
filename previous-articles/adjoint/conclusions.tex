\section{Conclusions\label{sec:Conclusions}}

This article has detailed a simple framework for finite-horizon optimal control 
methods on a network of scalar conservation laws derived from first 
discretizing the network via the Godunov method, then applying the discrete 
adjoint to this system. To tailor the framework to a specific application, one 
need only provide the partial derivatives of the Riemann solver at a network 
junction as well as the partial derivatives of the objective. Furthermore, we 
show that for this class of problems, the sparsity pattern allows the problem 
to be implemented with only linear memory and linear computational complexity 
with respect to the number of state and control parameters. We demonstrate the 
scalability of the approach by implementing a coordinated ramp metering 
algorithm using the adjoint method and applying the algorithm to the I-15 South 
freeway in California. The algorithm runs in a fraction of real-time 
and produces significant improvements over existing algorithms. The ramp 
metering algorithm has been fully implemented within Connected 
Corridors~\cite{CC} system, a project by UC Berkeley and PATH for integrated 
corridor management, as a component of the traffic simulator module. Future 
work includes investigating decentralized, coordinated control schemes over physical 
networks via the adjoint method to allow traffic control strategies to scale to 
regional-scale networks.
