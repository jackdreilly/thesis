\section{Numerical Results for Model Predictive Control Implementations\label{sec:Numerical-results-for}}

To demonstrate the effectiveness of using the adjoint ramp metering
method to compute gradients, we implemented the algorithm on practical scenarios with field experimental data.
The algorithm can then be used as a gradient computation subroutine
inside any descent-method optimization solver that takes advantage
of first-order gradient information. Our implementation makes use
of the open-source \emph{IpOpt} solver~\cite{Andreas2005}, an interior point, nonlinear program optimizer. To serve
as comparisons, two other case scenarios were run:
\begin{enumerate}
\item No control: the metering rate is set to 1 on all on-ramps at all times.
\item Alinea~\cite{Papageorgiou1991Alinea}: a well-adopted, feedback-based ramp metering
algorithm commonly used in the practitioner's community. Alinea is computationally efficient and decentralized,
making it a popular choice for large networks, but does not take estimated
boundary flow data as input. Since Alinea has a number of tuning parameters,
we perform a \emph{modified} grid-search technique over the different
parameters that scales linearly with the number of on-ramps, and select
the best-performing parameters, in order to be fair to this framework. A \emph{full} grid-search approach
scales exponentially with the number of on-ramps, rendering it infeasible
for moderate-size freeway networks.
\end{enumerate}
All simulations were run on a 2012 commercial laptop with 8 GB of RAM and a dual-core 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 processor.

\begin{note} To demonstrate the reduced running time associated with the adjoint approach, we also implemented a gradient descent using a finite differences approach similar to~\cite{Frejo2011,Ramon2013}, which requires an $O(\ntime^2\nlinks\ncontrols)$ computation for each step in gradient descent, but it proved to be computationally infeasible for even small, synthetic
networks. Running ramp metering on even a network of 4 links over
6 time-steps for 5 gradient steps took well over 4 minutes,
rendering the method useless for real-time applications. The comparison
of running times of finite differences versus the adjoint method is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Running-time-of}. Due to the impractically large running times associated with finite differences, we do not consider the finite differences in further results, which only becomes worse as the problem scales to larger networks and time horizons.

\subsection{Implementation of I15S in San Diego\label{sub:Network}}

As input into the optimization problem, we constructed a model of
a 19.4 mile stretch of the I15 South freeway in San Diego,
California between San Marcos and Mira Mesa. The network has $\nlinks=125$ links, and $\ncontrols=9$ on-ramps,
with boundary data specified for $\ntime=1800$ time-steps,
for a time horizon of 120 minutes given $\Delta t=$4 seconds.
The network is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Model-of-section}.

\caption{Model of section of I15 South in San Diego, California. The freeway
section spanning 19.4 miles was split into 125 links with 9 on-ramps.\label{fig:Model-of-section}}
\end{figure}


Link length data was obtained using the Scenario Editor software developed
as part of the \textit{Connected Corridors} project, a collaboration between
UC Berkeley and PATH research institute in Berkeley, California.
Fundamental diagram parameters, split ratios, and boundary data were
also obtained using calibration techniques developed by Connected
Corridors. Densities resulting in free-flow speeds were chosen as
initial conditions on the mainline and on-ramps. The data used in calibration
was taken from PeMS sensor data~\cite{Chen2003} during a morning rush hour period,
scaled to generate congested conditions. The input data was chosen
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adjoint ramp metering method
in a real-world setting. A profile of the mainline and on-ramps during
a forward-simulation of the network is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Density-and-queue}
under the described boundary conditions.

\end{figure}
						
						
						
\subsection{Finite-Horizon Optimal Control\label{sub:Finite-horizon-optimal-control}}
						
						
\paragraph{Experimental Setup.}
						
The adjoint ramp metering algorithm is compared to the reactive Alinea
scheme, for which we assume that perfect boundary conditions and initial conditions
are available. The metric we use to compare the different strategies is \emph{reduced-congestion} percentage, $\bar{c} \in \left(-\infty,100\right]$, which we define as:
\[
\bar{c} = 100 \left(1 - \frac{c_\text{c}}{c_{\text{nc}}}\right)
\]where $c_\text{c}, c_{\text{nc}} \in \mathbb{R}_+$ are the \emph{congestion} resulting from the \emph{control} and \emph{no-control} scenarios, respectively. We use the metric for congestion as defined in~\cite{Skabardonis2003}; for a given section of road $S$ and time horizon $T$, the congestion is given as
\[
c\left(S,T\right) = \sum_{\left(s\in S, \tau\in T\right)} \max \left[\text{TTT}\left(s,\tau\right) - \frac{\text{VMT}\left(s, \tau\right)}{v_s}, 0\right]
\] where $v_s$ is the free-flow velocity, $\text{VMT}$ is total vehicle miles traveled, and $\text{TTT}$ is total travel time over the link $s$ and time-step $\tau$. Since it is infeasible to compute the global optimum for all cases, a reduced congestion of 100\% serves as an upper bound on the possible amount of improvement.

\end{figure}
						
						
Fig.~\ref{fig:long-sim} shows a difference profile for both density and queue lengths between the
no control simulation and the simulation applying the ramp metering
policy generated from the adjoint method. Negative differences in
Figs.~\ref{fig:long-sim-density} and~\ref{fig:long-sim-queue}
indicate where the adjoint method resulted in fewer vehicles for the
specific link and time-step. The adjoint method was successful in
appropriately deciding which ramps should be metered in order to improve
throughput for the mainline.

\begin{figure}
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{images/longsim}
	\caption{Reduced congestion versus simulation time for freeway network. The results
		indicate that the algorithm can run with performance better than Alinea
		if given an update time of less than a minute.}
		\label{fig:running-time}
\end{figure}
								
Running time analysis shows that the adjoint method can produce beneficial
results in real-time applications. Fig.~\ref{fig:running-time} details the improvement of the adjoint method as a function of the overall running time of the algorithm. After just a few gradient steps, the
adjoint method outperforms the Alinea method. Given that the time
horizon of two hours is longer than the period of time one can expect
reasonably accurate boundary flow estimates, more practical simulations
with shorter time horizons should permit more gradient steps in a
real-time setting.
								
While the adjoint method leads to queues with a considerable number of cars in some on-ramps, this can be addressed by introducing barrier terms into the cost function that limit the
maximum queue length. The Alinea method tested for the I15 network
had no prescribed maximum queue lengths as well, but was not able
to produce significant improvements in total travel time reduction, while the adjoint method was
more successful.
								
								
\subsection{Model Predictive Control\label{sub:Model-predictive-control}}
								
To study the performance of the algorithm under noisy input data,
we embed both our adjoint ramp metering algorithm and the Alinea algorithm
inside of a \emph{model predictive control }(MPC) loop.
								
								
\paragraph{Experimental Setup.}
								
The MPC loop begins at a time $t$ by estimating the initial conditions
of the traffic on the freeway network and the predicted boundary fluxes
over a certain time horizon $T_{h}$. These values are noisy, as exact
estimation of these parameters is not possible on real freeway networks.
The estimated conditions are then passed to the ramp metering algorithm
to compute an optimal control policy over the $T_{h}$ time period.
The system is then forward-simulated over an update period of $T_{u}\le T_{h}$,
using the exact initial conditions and boundary conditions, as opposed
to the noisy data used to compute control parameters. The state of
the system and boundary conditions at $t+T_{u}$ are then estimated
(with noise) and the process is repeated.
								
A non-negative\emph{ noise factor}, $\noiseFactor \in \R_+$, is used to study how the adjoint
method and Alinea perform as the quality of estimated data decreases. If $\discrete{}{}$ is the actual density for a cell and time-step, then the density $\bar{\discrete{}{}}$ passed to the control schemes is given by:
\[
\bar{\discrete{}{}}=\discrete{}{}\cdot \left(1+\noiseFactor\cdot R\right)
\]
where $R$ is a uniformly distributed random variable with mean $0$
and domain $\left[-0.5,0.5\right]$. The noise factor was applied
to both initial and boundary conditions.
								
Two different experiments were conducted:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Real-time I15 South}: MPC is run for the I15 South network
	with $T_{h}=80$ minutes and $T_{u}=26$ minutes. A noise factor of
	2\% was chosen for the initial and boundary conditions. The number
	of iterations was chosen in order to ensure that each MPC iteration
	finished in the predetermined update time $T_{u}$.
	\item \textbf{Noise Robustness}: MPC is for over a synthetic network with
	length 12 miles and boundary conditions over 75 minutes. The experiments
	are run over a profile of noise factors between 1\% and 8000\%.
\end{enumerate}
								
\paragraph{Results.}
								
% \subparagraph{Real-Time I15 South.}
\textbf{Real-Time I15 South.} The results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:MPC-performance-on}.
The adjoint method applied once to the entire horizon with perfect
boundary and initial condition information serves as a baseline performance
for the other simulations, which had noisy input data and limited
knowledge of predicted boundary conditions. The adjoint method still
performs well under the more realistic conditions of the MPC loop
with noise, resulting in 2\% reduced congestion or 40 car-hours in relation to no control, as compared to the 3\% reduced (60 car-hours) congestion achieved by the adjoint method with no noise and full time horizon ($T_h=T$). In comparison, the Alinea method was only able to achieve 1.5\% reduced congestion (30 car-hours) for both the noisy and no-noise scenarios. The results indicate
that, under a realistic assumption of a 2\% noise factor in the sensor
information, the algorithm's ability to consider boundary conditions results in an improvement upon strictly reactive policies,
such as Alinea.

\end{figure}

% \subparagraph{Robustness to Noise.}																
\textbf{Robustness to Noise.} Simulation results on the synthetic network with varying levels of
noise are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Ramp-metering-performance-1}.
The adjoint method is able to outperform the Alinea method when the
noise level is less than 80\%, a reasonable assumption for data provided
by well-maintained loop detectors. As the initial and boundary condition
data deteriorates, the adjoint method becomes useless. Since Alinea
does not rely on boundary data, it is able to produce improvements,
even with severely noisy data. The results indicate that the adjoint
method will outperform Alinea under reasonable noise levels in the
sensor data.
